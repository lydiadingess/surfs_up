# Surf's Up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to examine weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii to secure an investment for a Surf and Ice Cream shop. The investor wanted to specifically focus on the months of June and December. To analyze the data, we used SQLAlchemy to query the SQLite database.  

## Results

![Dec_Temp_Stats](https://github.com/lydiadingess/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec_Temp.png?raw=true)

The results we found from the data presented a difference in average temperature between summer and winter months of about 4 degrees. The average temperature in June is 74.94 with max temps of 85 degrees, while the average temperature in December is 71.04 with max temps of 83 degrees. This presents ideal, year-round temperatures for an Ice Cream shop.

This graph shoes that most temperatures year round are over 67 degrees. Majority of the days of the year is going to have higher temperatures. This is ideal for a location for a ice cream and surf stop.

This chart gives us a summary of the precipitation in the previous year. The average amount of rainfall within the year was 0.18 inches. The rainfall is faily light. Customers will not have to worry about a rainstorm in the middle of a scoop of ice cream or riding a wave. 

## Summary

Oahu would be a great place to invest in a surf and ice cream shop. The weather data has shown that the weather is moderate all year- round and rarely too cool to enjoy some ice cream. There may be the occasional downpour of rain, but most days are clear.

If the investor needs additional information, these are two additional queries that I would preform.

  1. Average wind speed. Wind speed can have an impact on the quality of the swell.
  2. Average hour of sunshine in the summer and winter months. This will impact how long the shop could be open.
